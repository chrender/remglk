# From the original Makefile:
#
# "When you install remglk, you must put libremglk.a in the lib directory,
#  and glk.h, glkstart.h, and Make.remglk in the include directory."

libremglk.a     /usr/lib
glk.h           /usr/include/remglk
glkstart.h      /usr/include/remglk
Make.remglk     /usr/include/remglk
